### Hi there 👋

I'm Júlio César. Yes, just like the Roman emperor! Every day it feels like I'm ruling an empire (my life), but I'm just a humble student who has learned to be self-taught and to seek knowledge in various areas, programming, philosophy, physics, mathematics, personal development... in short, I love studying. 
In programming I discovered my talent for automating processes and I apply it to everything in my life.
Here I'll be posting various personal projects while I complete the courses I'm taking with the aim of becoming a Fullstack developer in the near future!
