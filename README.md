### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm JÃºlio CÃ©sar. Yes, just like the Roman emperor! Every day it feels like I'm ruling an empire (my life), but I'm just a humble student who has learned to be self-taught and to seek knowledge in various areas, programming, philosophy, physics, mathematics, personal development... in short, I love studying. 
In programming I discovered my talent for automating processes and I apply it to everything in my life.
Here I'll be posting various personal projects while I complete the courses I'm taking with the aim of becoming a Fullstack developer in the near future!  


## Current skills

- Programming Languages { PHP; Python; C#; C++; }
- Frameworks { Bootstrap; Laravel; }
- Other relevant skills:  Modeling skills { Flow Diagrams; UML (Unified Modeling Language); }


## Suggested books for other self-taught people

- Atomic habits (James Clear)
- Sophie's World (Jostein Gaarder)
- Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people (Aditya Y.Bhargava)
- Clean code (Robert Cecil Martin)
- How to think like a Computer Scientist (David Beazley)
